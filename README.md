#K8S-MLOps

The objective of this project is to transform a basic Kubernetes cluster into a fully functional MLOps platform by integrating Istio, KServe, and Kubeflow, enabling the deployment, serving, and monitoring of AI/ML applications in production environments.

##Key points:

The cluster already includes Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, as well as ArgoCD for GitOps deployment.

All ML models and applications will be deployed following GitOps principles, ensuring reproducible, declarative, and auditable deployments.

Provide a reliable and reproducible setup for AI/ML pipelines.

Ensure proper service mesh integration (Istio) for traffic management and security.

Deploy and manage Kubeflow components for workflows and pipelines.

Deploy KServe for serving machine learning models via InferenceServices.

Maintain scalable and production-ready architecture on Kubernetes.
